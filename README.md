## Synopsis

Learning from imbalanced data is a challenging task that has attracted much interest from scholars. While a substantial amount of research has been conducted to develop a plethora of approaches, only a limited number of studies have analyzed the efficacy of these techniques on a wide variety of imbalanced datasets. This study aims to fill that research gap by providing a comprehensive experimental analysis of the effectiveness of a wide range of techniques. We investigated the performance of 30 different state-of-the-art approaches used in imbalanced learning. The performance was evaluated on 84 different imbalanced datasets with varied imbalance ratios.
